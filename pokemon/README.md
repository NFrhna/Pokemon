## Tech Stack

- **React 19.2.0** - UI library
- **Vite 7.2.4** - Build tool and dev server
- **Tailwind CSS 4.1.18** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **PokéAPI** - RESTful Pokémon API (https://pokeapi.co)

Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Steps to Run

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd pokemon
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open in browser**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`
   - The app will automatically reload on code changes

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```
The production-ready files will be in the `dist/` folder.

## Design Decisions

### Component Architecture
- **Modular Components**: Separated into `PokemonCard`, `PokemonListItem`, and main `App` component for maintainability
- **Single File Structure**: Kept all components in one file for simplicity (can be split into separate files for larger projects)

### State Management
- **React Hooks**: Used `useState` for local state and `useEffect` for data fetching
- **No External Libraries**: Avoided Redux/Context API as the state is simple and localized

### API Integration
- **Parallel Fetching**: Used `Promise.all()` to fetch detailed Pokémon data in parallel for better performance
- **Pagination**: Implemented offset-based pagination (10 Pokémon per load)
- **Error Handling**: Added try-catch blocks and user-friendly error messages

### Styling Approach
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first approach for rapid development
- **Responsive Grid**: Used Tailwind's responsive utilities (`lg:grid-cols-2`)
- **Type Colors**: Created a color mapping for all 18 Pokémon types
- **Custom Scrollbar**: Added custom styling for better aesthetics

```

## Configuration Files

- **tailwind.config.js**: Configured to scan all JSX/TSX files
- **postcss.config.js**: Set up with @tailwindcss/postcss and autoprefixer
- **vite.config.js**: React plugin configuration

## Known Limitations

- Search only works on loaded Pokémon (not global search across all 1000+ Pokémon)
- No caching mechanism (refetches data on page reload)

## Notes

- The app uses official Pokémon artwork from PokéAPI's sprites
- All data is fetched from the free public PokéAPI (no authentication required)
- The app is client-side only (no backend required)

## Developer

Built as a technical assessment for demonstrating React and Tailwind CSS skills.
